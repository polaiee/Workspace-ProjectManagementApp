# **WORKSPACE: Project Management App**

## **About**
Workspace: Project Management App is an Android Application for designing an application defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. The project is used to provide a mobile application for project management. The App supports personal Task Boards, allowing simple and organized task tracking that separates overarching goals or topics from specific tasks. The project uses Android Studio as IDE, Kotlin for back-end development and Firebase for the database. We use Firebase to help users sign in and store their signup information and backup their task boards. The users who want to use the application should sign up first and can later sign in at any time using the same credentials. The purpose of this system is to develop a project task allocation interface where users can increase team productivity and the user-friendly designs help them to do so.
